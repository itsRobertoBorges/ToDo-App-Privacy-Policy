# Privacy Policy

Our to-do app ("App") is designed to help users manage their tasks and reminders. In order to provide this service, we collect and process certain information about our users. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, and protect the personal information of our users.

Information Collection and Use

The App does not collect or store any personal information about users, such as their name or contact information. The only information we collect is the information that is entered by the user into the app to create and manage their tasks.

Notifications

The App sends notifications to users 6 hours after they submit a task. These notifications are sent to the device on which the App is installed, and are not stored on our servers. Users can turn off these notifications at any time through the settings of their device.

No Special Permissions

The App does not request any special permissions from users.

Data Protection

We take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information we collect and process, including using appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at your convenience.

This policy is based on Canadian law and should be reviewed by a legal professional for your specific app and use case.
